  welcome_message: Hi there, noScribe is ready!
  welcome_credits: >
    
    Version %{v}, Kai Dröge 2023
    
    ported to macOS by Philipp Schneider
    
    powered by Whisper (OpenAI), faster-whisper (Guillaume Klein) & pyannote (Hervé Bredin)
  welcome_instructions: >

    Use the buttons on the left to select an audio file and a filename for your finished transcript.
    Please be patient. The transcription may take 2 to 5 times as long as your audio file. Test your settings 
    with a shorter section before transcribing the full audio. (Start = 00.00.00 and Stop = 00.03.00 will 
    transcribe the first 3 minutes.)   


    Enjoy!
